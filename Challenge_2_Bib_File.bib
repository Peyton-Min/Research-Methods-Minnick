   abstract = {While machine learning based spam detectors have proven useful, spammers are learning to bypass the detectors by modifying their email content. Adversarial attacks on machine learning models have been observed in domains such as image classification. Applying such adversarial attack algorithms to craft spam emails to evade spam email detectors, however, has limitations. Such algorithms generate adversarial perturbations in the feature space. Different from image data, translating the adversarial perturbations from the feature space to text formats, as in emails, changes the effectiveness of the adversarial perturbations. It can reduce the attack success rate in the case of spam email detection. In this paper, we study the feasibility of adversarial attacks on machine learning based spam detectors and propose two novel text crafting methods leveraging adversarial perturbations generated by the adversarial example generation algorithms to improve the attack effectiveness. One method tries to approximate the feature values and the other adds special words to original emails. In experimentation, we use PGD as an example to demonstrate and compare the effectiveness of our attack methods on spam email detectors. We also examine the transferability of the proposed attack methods on different machine learning models.},

   abstract = {Due to its ease of use, speed, adaptability, and ability to keep a complete record of correspondence, email is a commonly used and trusted communication medium. The vulnerability of these emails to cyberattacks has increased. This study utilized the hybrid-based sentiment analysis approach for email fraud detection. The lexicon-based using the Word2Vec feature and Machine Learning (ML) classification approach using both the Bag of Words and TF-IDF feature extraction techniques are adopted to optimize accuracy. The ML classifiers adopted are Random Forest, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression. The predictive and classification comparison of the ML models suggests that Random Forest slightly outperformed the other models with 87% accuracy and 78% F1-score and k-NN performed worst.},

   abstract = {The upsurge in the volume of unwanted emails called spam has created an intense need for the development of more dependable and robust antispam filters. Machine learning methods of recent are being used to successfully detect and filter spam emails. We present a systematic review of some of the popular machine learning based email spam filtering approaches. Our review covers survey of the important concepts, attempts, efficiency, and the research trend in spam filtering. The preliminary discussion in the study background examines the applications of machine learning techniques to the email spam filtering process of the leading internet service providers (ISPs) like Gmail, Yahoo and Outlook emails spam filters. Discussion on general email spam filtering process, and the various efforts by different researchers in combating spam through the use machine learning techniques was done. Our review compares the strengths and drawbacks of existing machine learning approaches and the open research problems in spam filtering. We recommended deep leaning and deep adversarial learning as the future techniques that can effectively handle the menace of spam emails.},
